# 🧠 PART 1: Why OOP Exists (VERY IMPORTANT)
# Problem with only functions
# Data and behavior are separate
# Hard to manage large systems
# Difficult to scale
# OOP Solution
# Bundle data + behavior together
# Real-life example:
# Student → name, age, marks + actions (calculate grade)
# ML Model → weights + train(), predict()

# 🧱 PART 2: What Is a Class?
# A class is a blueprint.
# class Student:
#     pass

# 👤 PART 3: What Is an Object?
# An object is a real instance created from a class.
# s1 = Student()
# s2 = Student()

# 🛠️ PART 5: First Real Class Example
# class Student:
#     def greet(self):
#         print("Hello, I am a student")
# s1 = Student()
# s1.greet()
# 👉 self means the current object

# 🧠 PART 6: Why ML Uses OOP
# Example (conceptual):
# model = LinearRegression()
# model.fit(data)
# model.predict(x)
# model → object
# fit, predict → methods
# parameters → attributes
# You’ll build this mindset step by step.
